#Doubly Linked lists
Doubly linked lists are linked lists that can be parsed forward and backward. each node in doubly linked lists has 3 variables: data variable + pointer to next node + pointer to previous node.
The first node has its pointer to previous node, pointing to NULL.
The last node has its pointer to next node, pointing to NULL.
